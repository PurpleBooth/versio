        New to Versio? The [repository](https://github.com/chaaz/versio) is the best place to learn about Versio and what it can do. If you want to report a bug or request a feature, you can do so at our [Issues](https://github.com/chaaz/versio/issues) link, but we ask you first read the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/chaaz/versio/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md) page learn about problems and their solutions.

        To install, follow the instructions for your platform; some files might be zipped for improved download speed. For example, on MacOS you can do something like this (assuming `~/bin` exists and is in your PATH):

        ```sh
        curl -L https://github.com/chaaz/versio/releases/download/${{ steps.find-version.outputs.version }}/versio__x86_64-apple-darwin -o ~/bin/versio
        chmod +x ~/bin/versio
        ```

        **MacOS:** download `versio__x86_64-apple-darwin`, copy to `versio` in your PATH.
        **GNU Linux 64:** download `versio__x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, copy to `versio` in your PATH.
        **Windows:** download `versio__x86_64-pc-win32.exe`, copy to `versio.exe` in your %PATH.
